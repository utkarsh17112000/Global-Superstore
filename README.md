# Global-Superstore
🚀 Leveling Up My Data Analysis Skills with the Global Superstore Dataset! 📊

Over the past few days, I’ve been diving deep into one of the most popular practice datasets – the Global Superstore – to sharpen my data analysis and visualization skills. 🧠💡

Here are just some of the key insights I explored:

✅ Total Sales by Country
✅ Top 5 Products by Profit
✅ Average Discount by Product Category
✅ Quantity Sold by Market
✅ Sales by Year & Quarter
✅ Top 10 Customers by Sales
✅ Order Segment & Priority Analysis
✅ Monthly Trends in Sales & Discounts
✅ Profitability by Sub-Category and Region
✅ Shipping Mode Cost & Performance
✅ Contribution % by Region
✅ Discount vs Sales Impact
...and many more!

From identifying top-performing products and regions to analyzing customer behavior and discount strategies — this project has helped me strengthen my storytelling with data using tools like Excel, Tableau, and SQL. 💻📈

   - Calculates total sales for each category and returns the top 5.

3. **Top 5 States with Most Orders**
   - Counts the number of orders per state and sorts by highest.

4. **Top 10 Customers by Total Sales**
   - Aggregates sales per customer and returns top 10 performers.

5. **Top 10 Sub-Categories by Sales**
   - Calculates total sales per sub-category and returns top 10.

6. **Average Profit per Discount Level**
   - Groups by discount and calculates average profit for each.

7. **Top 10 Products by Profit Margin**
   - Calculates `(Profit / Sales)` and ranks products by highest margin.

8. **Total Sales by Region (Sorted Descending)**
   - Aggregates sales by region and sorts from highest to lowest.

9. **Top 5 Most Profitable Products**
   - Aggregates total profit per product and returns top 5.

10. **Order Priority Distribution**
    - Counts total orders grouped by order priority.

11. **Country-wise Profitability**
    - Calculates total sales, total profit, and profit margin per country and ranks them.

12. **Top 10 Customers by Sales (Repeated for Practice)**
    - Re-evaluation of sales per customer.

13. **Monthly Sales Summary**
    - Formats order dates into `YYYY-MM` and sums monthly sales.

14. **Average Profit and Discount per Category**
    - Calculates averages grouped by product category.

15. **Average Shipping Time by Region**
    - Computes shipping time (in days) from order to ship date, grouped by region.
