ðŸš€ Leveling Up My Data Analysis Skills with the Global Superstore Dataset! ðŸ“Š

Over the past few days, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into one of the most popular practice datasets â€“ the Global Superstore â€“ to sharpen my data analysis and visualization skills. ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡

Here are just some of the key insights I explored:

âœ… Total Sales by Country
âœ… Top 5 Products by Profit
âœ… Average Discount by Product Category
âœ… Quantity Sold by Market
âœ… Sales by Year & Quarter
âœ… Top 10 Customers by Sales
âœ… Order Segment & Priority Analysis
âœ… Monthly Trends in Sales & Discounts
âœ… Profitability by Sub-Category and Region
âœ… Shipping Mode Cost & Performance
âœ… Contribution % by Region
âœ… Discount vs Sales Impact
...and many more!

From identifying top-performing products and regions to analyzing customer behavior and discount strategies â€” this project has helped me strengthen my storytelling with data using tools like Excel, Tableau, and SQL. ðŸ’»ðŸ“ˆ
